```

> To keep your balance, you must keep moving.

Blockquotes can be nested.

## Horizontal Rules

Horizontal rules can be created using three or more asterisks (\*\*\*), dashes (\-\-\-), or underscores (\_\_\_) on a line by themselves.

```markdown
*** 
----
______
```

## Inline code

```markdown
I think you should use an `<addr>` element here instead.

## Fenced Code Blocks

### No highlighting

````markdown

if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```
````

```

}
```

````markdown
```javascript

## Tabels 

```markdown
| First Header  | Second Header |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
```

| First Header  | Second Header |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |

```markdown
| Left-aligned | Center-aligned | Right-aligned |
| :---         |     :---:      |          ---: |
| git status   | git status     | git status    |
| git diff     | git diff       | git diff      |
```

| Left-aligned | Center-aligned | Right-aligned |
| :---         |     :---:      |          ---: |
| git status   | git status     | git status    |
| git diff     | git diff       | git diff      |

Your Markdown does't have to be pretty. 

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell. The outer pipes (`|`) are optional, and you don't need to make the table columns line up prettily.

```markdown
Less | Pretty | Markdown 
--- | --- | ---
1 | 2 | 3 
*Still* | `renders` | **as expected**
4 | 5 | 6
```

## Blackslash escape

Markdown allows you to use backslash escapes to generate literal characters which would otherwise have special meaning in Markdownâ€™s formating syntax.

| Name                  | Markdown  | Result |
| --------------------- | --------- | ------ |
| backslash             | `\\`      | \\     |
| backtick              | `` \` ``  | \`     |
| asterisk              | `\*`      | \*     |
| underscore            | `\_`      | \_     |
| curly braces          | `\{\}`    | \{\}   |
| square brackets       | `\[\]`    | \[ \]  |
| parentheses           | `\(\)`    | \(\)   |
| hash mark             | `\#`      | \#     |
| plus sign             | `\+`      | \+     |
| minus sign (hyphen)   | `\-`      | \-     |
| dot                   | `\.`      | \.     |
| exclamation mark      | `\!`      | \!     |

## Task Lists

```
- [x] this is a complete item 
- [ ] this is an incomplete it
```

## Inline HTML

Markdown also supports raw HTML.

```html
<dl>
  <dt>First Term</dt>
  <dd>This is the definition of the first term.</dd>
  <dt>Second Term</dt>
  <dd>This is one definition of the second term. </dd>
  <dd>This is another definition of the second term.</dd>
</dl>
```

<dl>
  <dt>First Term</dt>
  <dd>This is the definition of the first term.</dd>
  <dt>Second Term</dt>
  <dd>This is one definition of the second term. </dd>
  <dd>This is another definition of the second term.</dd>
</dl>

```html
<p>Markdown and HTML does *not* work **well**. Use <i>HTML</i> <b>tags</b> instead.</p>
