## Getting Involved

The goal of our website is to create a general knowledge collection about general IT topics. we would be very happy about your help! But what we don't want is to become a copy&paste collection.
Of course, many things are already very well described on the Internet, so we ask you to create a doc only if you can better describe, explain or expand the content.

There are several options to contribute to the website, if you want to:

* Report bugs and request features: If you find a bug or have an idea for a new feature, you can open an [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Datenschmutz/docs/issues/new/choose) in the repository. Be sure to include as much information as possible, including steps to reproduce the bug (if applicable) or details about the proposed feature. If you are reporting a bug, please include your operating system, browser, and version information.

* Fix bugs and implement features: If you have the skills and knowledge to fix a bug or implement a feature, you can submit a pull request. Before submitting your pull request, be sure to read the contribution guidelines (below) and follow the coding style of the project.

* Improve documentation: If you see a problem with the documentation on the website, you can submit a pull request to fix it. This includes typos, formatting issues, and outdated information. If you are making significant changes to the documentation, please consider opening an [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Datenschmutz/docs/issues/new/choose) first to discuss your proposed changes.
