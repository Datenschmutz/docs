## Code of Conduct

We have decided to create and maintain our website according to the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct, the corresponding version of which can be found on the [website](https://docs.datenschmutz.dev/CODE_OF_CONDUCT) itself and [here](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) on GitHub.
We ask you to follow these guidelines when creating content!

## Getting Involved

The goal of our website is to create a general knowledge collection about general IT topics. we would be very happy about your help! But what we don't want is to become a copy&paste collection.
Of course, many things are already very well described on the Internet, so we ask you to create a doc only if you can better describe, explain or expand the content.

There are several options to contribute to the website, if you want to:

- Modifying, enhancing and adding docs and cheat sheets via GitHub using a pull request.
- Contributing an idea via GitHub Issues - we take over the implementation if we like the idea.

## Issues

If you encounter an error or bug please use the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Datenschmutz/docs/issues/new/choose) function and **use the appropriate template**.

### New-Issues
When opening a new issue, always make sure to fill out the issue template. This step is important! If you omit this, it may cost us time to gather additional information and your issue may be closed if the effort is too high. Don't take this personally if this happens, and feel free to open a new issue once you've gathered all the information required by the template.

Please don't use the GitHub issue function for questions. If you have questions send us a DM.

## Our Deployment Process

the core of our website is right here on GitHub all changes made via commit or pull request merge in the main branch are live on the web within a few seconds.
