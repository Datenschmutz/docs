        ## Please help us help you!

        Before filing your issue, ask yourself:
        - Have you tried to reload the page with CTRL+F5 ("Ctrl + F5" reloads web page and cache)?
        - Does the problem occur only in one browser (e.g. Chrome) or in more than one?
        - Do I have basic ideas about where it goes wrong? (For example, if there are stack traces, are they pointing to one file?)

        Make the bug obvious. Ideally, we should be able to understand it without running any code.

        Bugs are fixed faster if you include:
        - An url to see the problem live (if possible)
        - Browser details (see below)
