        This template is strictly used for documentation and Cheat Sheet requests.

        If you followed a documentation but things don't work, take some time to consider if it's the documentation or something on your end is wrong.

        You may proceed directly to sending a pull request without filing this issue, and we can improve on your work.
        We rarely close documentation pull requests unmerged. If your documentation request is:

        - Relevant to a significant proportion of users
        - Is formatted reasonably decently

        If you think some of the requirements above are not met, or if you are not able to contribute yourself, the issue is still welcomed.
