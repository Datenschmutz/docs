# Install Teamspeak on Linux servers

This guide explains how to easily and quickly install a TeamSpeak[^1] server on your Linux Server

## Requirements

* Hosted server running Linux
* SSH Client e.g. [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)[^2]

import Admonition from '@theme/Admonition';
import PuTTYConnectionGuide from '@site/src/components/puttyconnection.js';

##### <PuTTYConnectionGuide></PuTTYConnectionGuide>

## Installation

### Update server

   ```bash
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
  ```

:::note
In this example, the name of the user is `"teamspeak"`. You can also specify a different name, but then you have to be aware to use your own user name instead of `"teamspeak"` in this guide.
:::

### Create a Teamspeak running user

  ```bash
  adduser --disabled-login teamspeak
  ```

  >The following queries like name, phone number can be skipped with the `ENTER` key.

### Switch to TeamSpeak user

  ```bash
  su teamspeak
  ```

### Access home directory

  ```bash
  cd
  ```

  > The home directory is named identical as the user, so the path is "/home/teamspeak" <- Irrelevant right now but good to know

### Copy Teamspeak download link

* Copy download link of the latest TeamSpeak server from [Teamspeak](https://www.teamspeak.com/en/downloads/#server)

> Click on the copy icon to the right of the server version, n most cases `Linux - Server 64-bit` should be the right one.

### Open PuTTy and download server archive

  ```bash
  wget https://YOUR-COPIED-LINK.tar.bz2
  ```

  > You can paste content into PuTTY by `right-clicking` **NOT CTRL+V**.

### Extract downloaded archive

  ```bash title="Use the [TAB] key to auto complete the command."
  tar xfvj teamsp
  ```

  > The result should look like this `tar xfvj teamspeak3-server_linux_amd64-3.13.7.tar.bz2`

### Delete downloaded archive

  ```bash title="Use the [TAB] key to auto complete the command."
  rm teamsp
  ```

  > The result should look like this `rm teamspeak3-server_linux_amd64-3.13.7.tar.bz2`

### Open Teamspeak directory

  ```bash
  cd teamspeak3-server_linux_amd64
  ```

### Accept license terms

  ```bash
  touch .ts3server_license_accepted
  ```

  > This creates a file which indicates that you **accepted** the license terms.

### Start Teamspeak server

:::caution SAVE YOUR ACCESS DATA!
During the first startup process you will be given the server admin `Privilege Key` and `Server-Query credentials`, please make sure to save them

  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
