## Installation
In case of Debian / Ubuntu system please perform following action:

```bash
sudo apt install s3fs
```

## Features[^1]

* large subset of POSIX including reading/writing files, directories, symlinks, mode, uid/gid, and extended attributes
* compatible with Amazon S3, and other S3-based object stores
* allows random writes and appends
* large files via multi-part upload
* renames via server-side copy
* optional server-side encryption
* data integrity via MD5 hashes
* in-memory metadata caching
* local disk data caching
* user-specified regions, including Amazon GovCloud
* authenticate via v2 or v4 signatures


## Limitations[^1]

*random writes or appends to files require rewriting the entire object, optimized with multi-part upload copy
* metadata operations such as listing directories have poor performance due to network latency
* non-AWS providers may have eventual consistency so reads can temporarily yield stale data (AWS offers read-after-write consistency since Dec 2020)
* no atomic renames of files or directories
* no coordination between multiple clients mounting the same bucket
* no hard link
* inotify detects only local modifications, not external ones by other clients or tools
